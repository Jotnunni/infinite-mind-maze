# Project Review

## Summary
- The repository currently only contains licensing and README documentation; no source code, assets, or build tooling are present.
- The README outlines intended gameplay and features for "Infinite Mind Maze" but the "How to Run" section is incomplete and no runnable implementation is available.

## Observations
- **Missing implementation**: There are no HTML/JS/CSS files or other assets needed to play or test the described game.
- **Incomplete setup instructions**: The README stops mid-way through the cloning step and does not provide commands for running or building the project.
- **Limited contributor guidance**: Without code, there is no information on architecture, contribution guidelines, or testing strategies.

## Recommendations
- Add the actual game source (HTML5 Canvas + JavaScript) and any supporting assets so the project can be run and evaluated.
- Flesh out the README with complete setup and run steps (e.g., how to serve the app locally, dependencies, and build/packaging notes if any).
- Include basic contribution and testing guidance once the code is available (e.g., linting, formatting, browser support expectations).
